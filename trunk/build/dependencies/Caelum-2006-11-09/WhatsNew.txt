Changes in version 0.2:
- Fixed issues:
  - Infinite far clipping distance
  - Shader profiles
  - Linux compatibility issue in the prerequisites
  - Issue with RenderQueueGroups. Now it's possible to use Caelum AND Ogre's built-in sky elements (skydome, skybox, skyplane)
- Added Eihort compatibility when using TextureUnitState::setTextureName()
- Added the CaelumListener interface to receive notifications of Caelum process state for custom operations
- Added CaelumSystem::registerAllToTarget() and unregisterAllToTarget() so that it's possible to register all the RenderTargetListeners in Caelum to a RenderTarget in a single step
