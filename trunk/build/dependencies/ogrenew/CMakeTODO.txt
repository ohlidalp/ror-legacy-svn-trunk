R OgreConfig.h in BINARY not SOURCE
R Well, nothing built in SOURCE. In fact, nothing at all should be changed under CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR; only under BINARY
  * Proably resolved?
* Put versions into OgrePrerequisites.h via CMake
* Put Demos under BINARY/Samples and copy the libs there on windows
  R This might need a plugins.cfg (or whatever it's called) to work properly
  * All the demos are built in the right places but plugins.cfg isn't quite accurate
  * Almost certainly doesn't work on Windows
  * Use InstallRequiredSystemLibraries to install runtime libraries on Windows?
R PkgConfig file libOgreMain.pc or whatever
* CPack
  * Started work on this
R Dependencies on Windows:
  * Should I use an environment variable or a CMake variable?
  * RESOLVED with a variable OGRE_DEPENDENCIES_DIR
