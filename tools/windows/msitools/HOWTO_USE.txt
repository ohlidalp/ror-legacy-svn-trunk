== Procedure to create a new VCCRTx.msi ==

1: install Wix 3.0 stable ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/ ) download there:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/files/WiX%20v3.0%20%28stable%29/3.0.5419.0%20RTM/wix3.0.5419.0-x86-setup.zip/download

2: create two UUIDs using an online GUID/UUID creator (they are basically random numbers) (e.g. http://www.guidgenerator.com/ )

3: create a new VCCRTx.wxs from a previous example (starting from VCCRT3.wxs), and do the following changes:
  -change the two UUIDs in Product Id and UpgradeCode with the ones you got from step 2 (VERY IMPORTANT!)
  -check the filename of the msm file, so the correct file is used (look into C:\Program Files\Common Files\Merge Modules\ and put what you have there)
   Do not put the policy msm. Do not put the debug versions, they can not be legally redistributed.

4: run build.bat
   
5: write down in this file the runtime version of each generated VCCRTx.msi (hint: open the msi with winrar and see the filenames)
  and don't forget to commit this file, the .wxs and .msi

IMPORTANT: ship only the VCCRT that matches the version in the manifest of the executables!
To see the manifest, you can open the executable in an hex editor and look at the end of the file.

== old instructions (obsolete) ==
4: run Candle:
"c:\Program Files\Windows Installer XML v3\bin\candle.exe" VCCRTx.wxs -out VCCRTx.wixobj

5: run Light:
"c:\Program Files\Windows Installer XML v3\bin\light.exe" VCCRTx.wixobj -out VCCRTx.msi   
you can safely ignore all the warnings (see: http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2007/02/13/building-an-msi-using-wix-v3-0-that-includes-the-vc-8-0-runtime-merge-modules.aspx )
