To compile and run:

1. Go into "examples/bin/release", and copy all of Ogre's release-mode DLLs into this folder.

2. Go into "examples/bin/debug", and copy all of Ogre's debug-mode DLLs into this folder.

3. Copy "OgreCore.zip" and the "Fonts" folder from Ogre's media folder into the
   PagedGeometry's "examples/media" folder

4. Open up "PagedGeometry.sln" in Microsoft Visual C++. Select
   "Project->PagedGeometry Properties" from the menu. Now click on the "Debugging" item
   on the left panel (under "Configuration Properties"). Click on the "Working Directory"
   item on the right, and enter "$(TargetDir)". This allows the EXE to locate the
   Ogre DLL files.


To learn more about how to use the library, take a look at the API documentation
in the comments in header files (particularly PagedGeometry.h).


Note: Please note that this is the Beta version of PagedGeometry 1.0. If you have any problems

Note: While this Beta version should be feature-complete, it does not have the full
documentation and examples that the final version will include.
